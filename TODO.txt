 - implement group merging
 - add groups for everyone (even to forever-alone people)
 - grep for TODO and HACK in the folder and fix em ^.^
 - fix the hack which allows the app to work only for groups > 1 :)
 - proper implement nationality cap with:
    + get number of rooms on the floor
    + subtract disabled rooms and RA apartments
    + and implement C('allocation.nationalityCap') as being a percentage instead of a hardcoded number
